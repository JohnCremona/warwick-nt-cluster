For some reason the mongodump script produces empty BSON files.
The mongorestore script doesn't like those and you need to avoid those while restoring the DB from a dump.
A script can be written to take care of this. 
However, since this is a worst case scenario I just leave here some pseudo code, that should take care of it, however never tested in real life:

1- Find all the empty BSON files
$ find . -size 0 -name "*.bson" | cut -f 1,2 -d. > empty_files

2- move everything associated to the empty_files somewhere else, for example:
$ cat empty_files | xargs -t -I {} mkdir -p ../ignore/{}
$ cat empty_files | xargs -t -I @ sh -c "mv  @.* ../ignore/@"

Now you should be good to go.

3- Something like this
$ mongorestore --drop -j 8 DIRECTORYWITHDUMP/
